Hoyt3\n1LACT, Paris\n2University Paris Descartes, CERMES3, Paris\n3Independent practice, Mill Valley\nThe theory of redundant attempted solutions (RAS) is described from its origins to today. Based in cybernetics\nand introduced at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto, California, the main principle of RAS is that repeat-\ning an unsuccessful solution may actually serve to perpetuate and further entrench a problem. A true reducer of\ncomplexity, a definition of RAS is presented that appreciates biopsychosocial dimensions of diagnosis and inter-\nvention. Data are also presented from SYPRENE, a systemic therapy practice research network that documents\nthe use of strategic interventions to stop RAS.\nKeywords: redundant attempted solutions, mechanisms of change, strategic-systemic therapy, cybernetics, Mental\nResearch Institute\nKey Points\n1. The concept of redundant attempted solutions (RAS) originated at the Mental Research Institute in Palo\nAlto, California.\n2. The main principle of RAS, based in systemic thinking, is that repeating an unsuccessful attempt to solve a\nproblem may actually serve to perpetuate and further entrench the problem.\n3. The main purpose of the therapist, therefore, is to disrupt repetitions of RAS.\n4. RAS are often based on the (il)logics of avoidance or false control \u2013or some combination of these.\n5. Evidence is presented from SYPRENE, an international systemic therapy practice research network, sup-\nporting the therapeutic problem-solving effectiveness of stopping RAS.\nWe cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\nAlbert Einstein\nDarwin (1859) pointed out that the survival of a species may be threatened by its\ninability to abandon what was at one time an optimal (and therefore non-\npathological) adaptation, but whose obstinate maintenance in the face of changing\nenvironmental conditions may ultimately threaten its survival. The belief that the\noptimal solution has been found (combined with the persistent attempt to \u2018perfect\u2019\nthis solution strategy in the face of increasing dif\ufb01culties) blinds people to change\nstrategies that can be present and available at any time.

He\ncalled it the repetition compulsion .\nA human system caught in this vicious circle is likely to expect from therapy one\nand only one form of help: \u2018Change us without changing us ...\u2019 (Watzlawick, 1997,\np. 277). It is ensnared and trapped in what can be called an \u2018endless game,\u2019 in which\nrecurring behaviours are strictly governed by rules but without any rules for changingthe rules (see Fraser & Solovey, 2007). Not recognising the important differencebetween a \ufb01rst-order change (a change of one or more rules in the system without\nchanging the system) and a second-order change (a change in the system rules them-\nselves) as the way out of this circle (Bateson, 1972; Fisch et al., 1982; Hoyt, 2011;Weakland et al., 1974), only maintains and deepens the (dysfunctional) status quo.The concept of redundant attempted solutions (RAS) can, therefore, provide an effec-\ntive and ef\ufb01cient way out of such impasses.\nHow was the RAS concept developed? What is the potential role of the RAS\nconcept in today\u2019s therapies? How can we evaluate its ef\ufb01ciency? In this article, wewill examine the RAS concept and its evoluti on. We will introduce the research net-\nwork SYPRENE and analyse what we can learn about RAS with data from the net-work.\nFrom the repetition compulsion to the concept of redundant attempted solution\nAs Watzlawick (1997) points out, Freud (1914) thought of repetitive behaviours assymptoms, but he did not consider these behaviours to be central to the formation ofa problem and its persistence. Frankl\u2019s work (1963, p. 116) also takes into accountrepetitive and paradoxical dimensions that led him, for example, to declare that \u2018thefear of insomnia creates a hyperintention to sleep that eventually keeps you awake,\u2019but even if the phenomenon of redundancy in the client\u2019s problem had been noted, itwas only approached from a linear (not systemic) causal perspective.\nWender (1968, p. 309) in his theory of vicious and virtuous circles , evokes the con-\ncept of deviation amplifying feedback (DAF):\nThis explanatory mechanism is usually introduced ad hoc so that its generality and\napplicability are not recognized. It is most commonly identi\ufb01ed in its pathological\nform, the vicious circle, although the similar mechanism, with bene\ufb01cent effects, has\nbeen noted and called the virtuous circle. Both vicious and virtuous circles are examplesof what is called, in cybernetic terms, positive feedback, or what Maruyama has called\n\u201cdeviation amplifying feedback.\u201d\nThe recognition of DAF leads to the implication that \ufb01xed behaviour patterns\nmay be sustained by present \u2013not past \u2013forces. This does not deny the existence\nand importance of attitudes, values, or habits, nor the role of unconscious motivation.It does raise the useful question, however, of whether or not persistent behaviour isdue to these factors \u2013that is, whether behaviours are rigid because they were learned\nat an early developmental stage, imprinted, or acquired in a hypnoid state.\nIf we look at the DSM-5 (APA, 2015), which is intended to be atheoretical, the\nexample of the diagnostic criteria for a \u2018speci\ufb01c phobia,\u2019 avoidance conduct, is citedseveral times as a symptom, although it is not considered to be the essential character-istic of this disorder and even less so to be the cause or maintainer of the disorder.Redundant Attempted Solutions and SYPRENE\n\u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT) 175", "position": "chunk_2", "metadata": {"page_range": "3-5", "section": "M\u00e9thodologie", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-2", "content": "s citedseveral times as a symptom, although it is not considered to be the essential character-istic of this disorder and even less so to be the cause or maintainer of the disorder.Redundant Attempted Solutions and SYPRENE\n\u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT) 175\n\nAnother clue was noted by Rorhbaugh and Shoham (2001), who quote Jay Haley:\n\u2018Also at variance with the pathology-focused psychodynamic viewpoint was [Milton]Erickson\u2019s take on why people have problems in the \ufb01rst place. Rather than viewingproblems as \u201csymptoms\u201d of some deeper, underlying pathology, Erickson\u2019s implicit\nassumption was that problems arise from the mishandling of common, everyday dif\ufb01-\nculties encountered in the course of the family life cycle.\u2019\nThe systemic and biopsychosocial perspective\nIn each action we must look beyond the action at our past, present, and future state,\nand at others whom it affects, and see the relations of all those things. And then we\nshall be very cautious.\nBlaise Pascal, Pens /C19ees (1670/1869 \u20131872, p. 378)\nIn 1925, the biologist and psychologist Ludwig Von Bertalanffy began work on a\ngeneral theory that would enable living things to be approached as systems. His majorbook (1969) shows his claim to make general systems theory a meta-logico-\nmathematical discipline intended to concern all sciences. He argues that a living\norganism cannot be understood by studying separately each of its \u2018components,\u2019 but\nas interactions between its different parts, its organisation, its exchanges with its envi-ronment, etc. In 1948, the term cybernetics was coined by Norbert Wiener. At that\ntime, he de\ufb01ned it as \u2018the study of control and communication in the animal and themachine\u2019 (1948, pp. 14 \u201318). In 1951, Gregory Bateson and J \u20acurgen Ruesch published\na book that laid the foundation for the cybernetic approach to communication. Inthis book they observe that the rules of a relationship are not de\ufb01ned once and forall. There is a perpetual mutual adaptation, conscious or not: it is a process with feed-\nback. All living things adapt, everything that does not adapt stagnates and dies. This\nis true in both biology and interpersonal relations. Hence, a problem-solving interven-tion is about change. This conception may seem elementary, but as Bateson andRuesch (1951, p. 7) note, \u2018the knowledge of a supposed whyis neither necessary nor\nsuf\ufb01cient to change.\u2019 The question that interests us is how this problem is being\nmaintained here and now. Knowing putative root causes in the past seldom allows forchange in the present.\nThe biopsychosocial model was introduced by George Engel (1977, 1981) at the\nend of the 1970s. At that time, both psychoanalytical currents and biological reduc-\ntionism dominated. Engel criticises reductionism as unscienti\ufb01c and points out thatin a biological system, no element can be understood except in relation to the whole \u2013\nthey are all intertwined and inexorably inseparable. The roots of his biopsychosocialmodel were derived from general systems theory. Engel was able, based on the workof Paul Weiss and von Bertalanffy (see Von Bertalanffy, 1969) to examine \u2018how thebiopsychosocial model allows the physician [including psychiatrists] to extend theapplication of the scienti\ufb01c method to aspects of daily practice and patient care\u2019\n(Engel, 1981, p. 102).\nFor Bateson and Ruesch (1951, p. 28), the unit to consider is the overall social\nsituation: \u2018A social situation is established when people enter into interpersonal com-munication.\u2019 The system to be taken account of, when considering the health of anindividual, is the entire biopsychosocial system.

In\ntheir manifesto To End the Stranglehold of the DSM , Douville (2012, p. 7) states that:\n\u2018the most recent scienti\ufb01c advances in the \ufb01eld of neuroplasticity or epigenesis showthat it is no longer possible to oppose psychological and organic casualties, since the\nformer in\ufb02uences the construction of the latter.\u2019 Similarly, Lieberman (2015), a bio-\nlogically oriented psychiatrist, strongly argues for a \u2018pluralistic psychiatry\u2019 that combi-nes brain and mind; the mind is not the same as the brain. When research on mentalillnesses reduces the individual\u2019s \ufb01eld in its biological prism, it neglects the psychoso-cial domain and encounters dif\ufb01culties in seeking to identify explanatory and main-taining factors. Isolating one area from other areas is a fundamental epistemologicalerror in the way complexity is addressed. Indeed, as will be further discussed below,systems theory (Von Bertalanffy, 1969) teaches us that the whole is more and differ-\nent than the sum of its parts.\nThe Mental Research Institute: The birth of the concept of \u2018attempted solutions\u2019\nAs we will discuss below, Stafford Beer (1967, 1970) developed the concept of a com-\nplexity reducer , which inspired the authors at the Mental Research Institute (MRI).\nThe concept of attempted solutions was formalised in the article \u2018Brief Therapy:Focused Problem Resolution\u2019 in which Weakland, Fisch, Watzlawick, and Bodin(1974) iconically express the concept of attempted solutions as \u2018The problem is thesolution.\u2019 As Watzlawick and Weakland (1977, p. 281) explain:\nWe assume that once a dif\ufb01culty begins to be considered a \u201cproblem,\u201d the continua-\ntion, and often the exacerbation of this problem comes from the formation of a closed-\nloop positive feedback system, which most often revolves around the behaviors of indi-viduals in the system, designed to solve the dif\ufb01culty: the original dif\ufb01culty is the sub-\nject of an attempt at a \u2018solution\u2019 that intensi\ufb01es the original dif\ufb01culty, and so forth.\nFor the MRI team, the very effort that was being made to eliminate the problem\ncould be the same effort that kept it going and made it worse. Thus, Wittezaele andGarcia (1992) recount comments made by Richard Fisch: \u2018In our discussions, wecalled them \u201csolutions\u201d, until we \ufb01nally said to ourselves: \u201cBut they are not solutions,let\u2019s call them \u2018attempted solutions\u2019 because, in fact, they do not solve anything.\u201d\u2019 AsRohrbaugh and Shoham (2001, p. 66) summarise:\nThe model of brief therapy developed [ ...] in Palo Alto is based on identifying and\ninterrupting ironic processes that occur when repeated attempts to solve a problem keep\nthe problem going or make it worse. Formulations of ironic problem-solution loopsprovide a template for assessment and strategic intervention, indicating where to look\nto understand what keeps a problem going [...] Whether occurring within or between\npeople, these processes persist because problem and attempted solution become inter-twined in a vicious cycle, or positive feedback loop, in which more of the solution leads\nto more of the problem, leading to more of the same solution, and so on.\nIn their book Propagations , Weakland and Ray (1995) identify attempted solu-\ntions as the cornerstone of MRI\u2019s work. Thus, Wittezaele and Nardone (2016, p.69) comment: \u2018It is these unsuccessful efforts to \ufb01nd relief [that the Palo AltoSchool] considers the therapist\u2019s \ufb01rst job to stop this dysfunctional process.\u2019 Thetarget of treatment thus becomes the cessation of attempts at a solution which,instead of allowing the problem to disappear, aggravates the situation by a processof amplifying the dif\ufb01culty.Redundant Attempted Solutions and SYPRENE\n\u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT) 177", "position": "chunk_4", "metadata": {"page_range": "7-9", "section": "Introduction", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-4", "content": " treatment thus becomes the cessation of attempts at a solution which,instead of allowing the problem to disappear, aggravates the situation by a processof amplifying the dif\ufb01culty.Redundant Attempted Solutions and SYPRENE\n\u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT) 177\n\nOther authors also have suggested the importance of not continuing unsuccessful\nattempts at solution. For example, in their work with \u2018intimidating cases,\u2019 Fisch andSchlanger (1999, p. 2, italics in original) write: \u2018Thus the thrust of therapy is not toget the complainants to dosomething so much as to stopwhat they have been doing\nabout the problem [...] In that sense, we would say that we don\u2019t treat problems, we\ntreat attempted solutions.\u2019 Nardone and Portelli (2005, p. 73) instruct their clients:\u2018Every day, choose a small but concrete thing as if you had already overcome yourproblem, and voluntarily put it into practice. Every day choose something different.\u2019\nAlong similar lines, de Shazer (1988) counsels the solution-focused rule, \u2018If it\ndoesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t do it again; do something different\u2019; O\u2019Hanlon (1999) advises\u2018Do one thing different\u2019; Hoyt (2017, p. 220) says, \u2018Get the client to do somethingdifferent or differently \u2013more of the same does not make a change\u2019; and Soo-Hoo\n(2019) recommends \u2018the 180-degree turn in therapeutic interventions.\u2019 As Bobele\n(2019, p. 33, italics in original) explains: \u2018[MRI] described a problematic, interac-tional cycle where participants reciprocally escalated ineffective efforts to change oneanother\u2019s behavior in an attempt to solve their mutual problem [...] [Based on the]understanding of the positive feedback loop that maintained the problematic situation[their] recommended solution was deceptively simple \u2013interrupt the problematic cycle.\u2019\nMark McKergow (2021, p. 23) similarly notes: \u2018For the MRI team, a problem ariseswhen a dif\ufb01culty is mishandled and persists, producing a situation which is dead-\nlocked, knotted or an impasse. The problem situation is being held in place, unwit-\ntingly, by the actions that the family are trying to take to resolve it !A vicious cycle\nhas been created, where \u201cmore of the same\u201d leads to \u201cyet more of the same\u201d. As theproblem is the result of continued misapplication of the wrong attempted solution,the therapist\u2019s job is to have them stop doing that and do something else.\u2019\nThe epistemological basis of a meta-model: Interactional psychotherapy from a\ncybernetic perspective\nPascal (1869 \u20131872) expressed with dazzling intuition the concept of non-separation\nin Nature: \u2018The parts of the world all have such a relationship and such a sequencewith each other that I believe it is impossible to know each other without the otherand without the whole.\u2019 This means that to know is always to connect and not toseparate, decompose, or oppose, which is often a characteristic of the butchery of theordinary intellect.\nAs explained by Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson (1967), systemic therapists\neschew linear formulations (such as \u2018A causes B\u2019), preferring to work from a \u2018meta-\nperspective\u2019 that focuses on circular causal explanations in which problems both origi-\nnate and are sustained by patterns of interacting with important others. Hence, Wat-zlawick explains (in Nardone & Watzlawick, 2005, p. 3): \u2018[M]odern family therapy...no longer asks, \u201cWhy is the identi\ufb01ed patient behaving in this bizarre, irrational\nfashion?\u201d but rather, \u201cIn what sort of human system does this behavior make senseand is perhaps the only possible behavior?\u201d and \u201cWhat sort of solution has this systemso far attempted?\u201d\u2019\nRedundant attempted solutions: A \u2018complexity reducer\u2019\nFor the theoretician Stafford Beer (1967, 1970), solving a complex problem with aseemingly simple solution requires what he calls a complexity reducer .

Hoyt\n178 \u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT)\n\nthe repetitive nature of the unsuccessful attempted solution) is a major step forward\nbecause it is precisely a reducer of complexity in terms of formalisation and problem-solving. This concept of attempts at solution makes it possible to bring to Engel\u2019sbiopsychosocial model the key systemic property of emerging quality aimed at reduc-\ning complexity without distorting it.\nWatzlawick (1997, p. 277) describes precisely the meaning of and interest in the\nattempts at a solution:\nIn our work at the MRI, we have gradually achieved a complexity reducer that seems\nto us to be the most practical and therefore the most useful when confronted with the\ncomplexity of human interaction: the attempted solution. After obtaining what appears\nto be a suf\ufb01ciently clear de\ufb01nition of the problem, we ask our clients what they havedone so far to solve it and what advice they have received from others. This informa-tion is relatively easy to obtain and allows us to identify the very mechanisms by which\nthe system maintains its homeostasis.\nRAS (Vitry et al., 2020, 2021) are: \u2018Communication actions repeatedly\nattempted by the person, his entourage or his cultural system to solve a life dif\ufb01-\nculty with him/herself, others or the world, without succeeding; they create a prob-lem that they perpetuate and aggravate by keeping the affected person(s) blocked ina restricted perception of the situation. These redundant actions, which can generatefurther emotional distress, take the form of language, behaviors or thoughts, inten-tional or unintentional. They have been learned and are perceived as consistentthrough feedback.\u2019\nEvolution of the concept of redundant attempted solutions in strategic therapy\nWittezaele and Nardone (2016, p. 264) indicate that their position is \u2018to identify thesystemic causal links that explain how the problem works and sustains itself, not toseek to determine where it originated or to try to make sense of it. The way is thenopen to propose reframing and tasks that will go in the direction desired by thepatient and marked out by the therapist.\u2019\nThinking in terms of process requires, as we present in the following diagram:\n(1) to take into account what is perceived (PERCEPTION) and (2) to take into\naccount the usual REACTIONS (REACTION =REPEATING ACTIONS). That\nis, in the end, to be able to address any complex situation in terms of mentalhealth according to what Nardone (Nardone & Balbi, 2012, p. 94) calls thePerceptive-Reactive System . As shown in Figure 1, this requires a systemic-\ninteractional biopsychosocial perspective.\nThe RAS ends up con\ufb01rming the underlying perceptions, sensations, and emo-\ntions, thus keeping vicious circles operative. Changing rigid perceptions can take place\nby reframing and using performative language, such as prescriptions/homework, that\nblock RAS and enable clients to experience different emotions and realities \u2013which\nWilliam James and Milton Erickson (see Short, 2020) both consider fundamental tochange and which Alexander and French (1946) call a \u2018corrective emotional experi-ence\u2019 (see Figure 2).\nThe processes of RAS\nMental health disorders can be mapped onto two types of processes.

Looking for solutions to \ufb01ll the gap between\nlaboratory and naturalistic psychotherapy outcome studies, practice research networks\n(PRNs) were introduced in the 1990s, in the hope that large numbers of cases com-ing from real-life clinical practice would allow speci\ufb01c information valid for everydaypractice and thus greater generalisability of results and conclusions to be obtained.SYPRENE was developed to accomplish this with systemic therapies, beginning withthe MRI strategic approach (Vitry et al., 2020).\nMethod\nParticipants\nBetween 2015 and 2020, 1,277 individual clients2with completed cases across a wide\nvariety of diagnoses were registered in the SYPRENE database by 22 systemic and\nstrategic practitioners working in \ufb01ve countries (French, n=14; Italian, n=4; Mexi-\ncan, n=2; Spanish, n=1; Canadian, n=1). Clients self-identi\ufb01ed as 35% male\nand 65% female; their average age was 40.5 years old. Practitioners reported havingan average of 16 years of experience as psychologists ( n=9), therapists/counsellors\n(n=7), or psychotherapists ( n=6). All practitioners identi\ufb01ed themselves as \u2018strate-\ngic therapists\u2019 and four also speci\ufb01ed Ericksonian hypnotherapy as a secondary special-isation. All clients were seen in private practice (not in public clinics or hospitals).\nAssessments\nData in SYPRENE are collected from both practitioners and clients, and then entereddigitally into the data-recording system by the practitioners (Vitry et al., 2020). Prac-titioners all undergo an initial 90-minute training in the use of SYPRENE, and thenengage in a monthly online conference to discuss cases and assessments.\nStandardised information for each client\u2019s case is recorded:\n/C15date, time, duration and setting of a session;\n/C15practitioner\u2019s problem diagnosis, level of potential risk;\n/C15type of session (\ufb01rst appointment, continuing, last appointment);\n/C15client\u2019s evaluation of the therapeutic alliance (Session Rating Scale/SRS, Miller &Duncan, 2004 \u2013discussed below) scores obtained after each session;\n/C15stage of the therapy (e.g., de\ufb01ning the objective of the therapy; unblocking [prob-\nlem attempted solution]; consolidation [when problem is solved]; follow-up at6 months; type of ending [completed or drop-out]);\n/C15client\u2019s evaluation of the outcome: (1) General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12 \u2013\ndiscussed below) scores obtained before the \ufb01rst, fourth, and after the last session;(2) Outcome Rating Scale/ORS (Miller & Duncan, 2004) for each session;\n3(3)Redundant Attempted Solutions and SYPRENE\n\u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT) 181", "position": "chunk_8", "metadata": {"page_range": "11-15", "section": "M\u00e9thodologie", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-8", "content": "stionnaire (GHQ-12 \u2013\ndiscussed below) scores obtained before the \ufb01rst, fourth, and after the last session;(2) Outcome Rating Scale/ORS (Miller & Duncan, 2004) for each session;\n3(3)Redundant Attempted Solutions and SYPRENE\n\u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT) 181\n\nclient\u2019s evaluation of the problem-solving outcome (on an 11-point scale) at the\nend of the therapy; (4) client\u2019s evaluation of change (to what extent \u2013not at all ,lit-\ntle,mostly ,o rcompletely ) before the fourth and after the last session;\n/C15practitioners\u2019 evaluation of the problem-solving outcome (on an 11-point scale) at\nthe end of the therapy.\nResults\nTreatment effectiveness and intensity (length of effective intervention)\nWith SYPRENE it is possible to evaluate the relationship between length and effec-tiveness of therapy, de\ufb01ned by the number of cases in which the problem situation is\nresolved or improved. As reported in Vitry et al. (2021), the data show that (1) 59%are completed in l to 5 sessions ( n=754); (2) 28% in 6 to 10 sessions ( n=358);\n(3) only 13% of cases required more than 10 sessions ( n=164). According to the\npractitioners\u2019 evaluations, a signi\ufb01cant improvement or complete problem resolutionwas achieved in 79% of cases, with an average of 5.9 sessions and 5.5 months lengthof treatment. These results indicate that it is possible to obtain very good results inless than 10 sessions (90%, n=890). SYPRENE data indicate the average duration\nof treatment 5.5 months.\nEffectiveness was assessed on an 11-point scale (from 0 to 10), by both the thera-\npist and the client, according to whether the problem that led the client to consultwas considered resolved ,improved ,o runresolved . Ratings also indicated whether or not\nthe therapist had helped the client to stop his or her redundant attempted solutions(RASs), which are conceptualized as the perpetuating force behind his or her problem.Outcome was further assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12;Goldberg & Williams, 1991), a well-documented 12-item instrument measuring\n\u2018mental distress\u2019 that is completed by the client. Client self-ratings of resolved/im-\nproved/not improved and of GHQ-12 scores showed similar improvements (see Vitryet al., 2021).\nRAS observation\nThirty-nine attempted solutions have been listed by the SYPRENE research group,based in particular on the recent work of Wittezaele and Nardone (2016): 13 corre-spond to avoidance , and 26 are associated with a will to control . In SYPRENE, how-\never, because encoding RAS is not mandatory, they were only reported in 17% ( n=\n220) of cases. The distribution of RAS is as follows: (1) control in 79% of those 220\ncases, (2) avoidance in 76% of cases. Among the RAS related to avoidance , the main\nones are: (1) avoiding social situations that generate fear (35%); (2) avoiding necessaryregulations (19%); and (3) denying information or emotions or trying to escape fromthem (18%). The main RAS related to control are: (1) wanting to control one\u2019s beha-viour (28%); (2) wanting to control one\u2019s emotional reactions rationally (22%); and(3) ruminations (22%).\nFor example, a male client suffered from social phobia which led him to stay at\nhome and give up all social activities. The therapist identi\ufb01ed that the client avoidedall feelings of fear (RAS 1) and avoided social situations generating fear (RAS 2).

Hoyt\n182 \u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT)\n\nhe could regain control over his sense of fear in social situations. When he did this,\nthe client was instructed to then assess whether his situation had been resolved, hadimproved, or was unresolved.\nIn the strategic approach, the goal of intervention is to stop RAS. Emotional experi-\nence is at the heart of strategic intervention. During therapy, the nature of the emotion\nobserved by the practitioner can be identi\ufb01ed in SYPRENE. For the 342 clients forwhom an emotion was rated (a client could score on more than one emotion) the resultsare as follows: (1) fear ( n=221); (2) anger ( n=173); (3) psychic pain\n4(n=136); (4)\nguilt ( n=84); (5) shame ( n=60); (6) pleasure ( n=22); (7) disgust ( n=11); (8) jeal-\nousy ( n=6); and (9) surprise ( n=1). SYPRENE also allows the practitioner to record\nthe different categories of RAS. Relying on practitioners\u2019 assessments (as a naturalisticPRN study, there were no audio or videotapes of sessions and no independent observers)\nthe most common RAS observed ( n=76) concerned clients who \u2018avoid social situations\nthat generate fear (e.g. fear of rejection, judgment, ridicule, refusal ...)\u2019. This dysfunc-\ntional process of emotional regulation corresponds to what Gross (2002) calls \u2018avoidanceof situations that trigger negative emotion.\u2019 The second most common RAS ( n=49)\nobserved by practitioners concerned clients who want to \u2018control their emotional reac-tions rationally,\u2019 a form of dysfunctional emotional regulation in which the person triesto put at a distance, through a cognitive process, a sensation that they fear. The thirdmost common observed RAS identi\ufb01ed was for clients who \u2018deny emotions or informa-\ntion\u2019 ( n=40). They are in a state of avoidance that neutralises certain painful aspects of\na situation; in terms of emotional regulation, these people develop a form of modi\ufb01ca-tion of the representation of the situation so that it loses its emotional signi\ufb01cance. Byfollowing the main prescriptions, the emotional dimension is once again at the centre ofthe strategic intervention.\nThe strategic-systemic approach is based on a feedback concept that makes a com-\nplex learning process of change visible with RAS. In cybernetic terms, the practitionerplaces the therapeutic alliance at the centre of intervention, constantly taking into\naccount both the client\u2019s position and feedback (e.g., regarding improvement), and\nthus continuously in\ufb02uencing and readjusting the evolution of the therapy for boththe therapist and the client (see Figure 2).\nSYPRENE (Vitry et al., 2020) takes into account different elements (in order to\nbetter analyse the link between the intervention and the effect obtained: (1) RAS withevaluation of the problem-solving outcome from the client\u2019s and therapist\u2019s perspec-tive; (2) effect of homework and reframing; (3) emotional change; and (4) since2019, the ORS/SRS\n5(Miller & Duncan, 2004) have also been administered. When\nlarger data samples are collected, these assessments will make it possible to better\nunderstand the processes that help to resolve clients\u2019 problems.\nConclusions\nThe theory of RAS explains the development of how one adapts in ways that inadver-tently perpetuate the problem. As Watzlawick and Weakland (1977, p. 512) state:\u2018From this perspective, there is evidence that what has caused a problem to emerge \u2013\nthese may be minor or rather ordinary causes \u2013is often less important than what\ncauses the problem to persist and develop.\u2019\nThe reports of 27 systemic and strategic therapists across 8 countries, collected by\nSYPRENE, found that the most common RAS identi\ufb01ed and used involved logicsRedundant Attempted Solutions and SYPRENE\n\u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT) 183", "position": "chunk_10", "metadata": {"page_range": "16-18", "section": "Introduction", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-10", "content": "persist and develop.\u2019\nThe reports of 27 systemic and strategic therapists across 8 countries, collected by\nSYPRENE, found that the most common RAS identi\ufb01ed and used involved logicsRedundant Attempted Solutions and SYPRENE\n\u00aa2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT) 183\n\nintended to control oravoid . Consistent with the theory of RAS from which the MRI\nstrategic approach was derived, when people try to solve situations that they meet byusing these strategies, they often perpetuate the very problems they seek to solve. Dis-rupting RAS can resolve \u2018stuckness\u2019 and allow change to occur. In MRI-style strategic-\nsystemic therapy (Fisch et al., 1982; Nardone & Portelli, 2005; Nardone & Watzlawick,\n1993, 2005; Watzlawick et al., 1974) this is accomplished as the practitioner and clientcontinuously provide one another with feedback and make adjustments.\nWhile our measures all rely on prima facie self-reports made by clients and their\ntherapists, credibility comes from the good correspondence between the various evalu-ations with the following implications: (1) strategic therapy is effective when measuredfrom clients\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 perspectives regarding improvement of both the prob-lem situation and clients\u2019 feelings of subjective distress; and (2) practitioners\u2019 and cli-\nents\u2019 evaluations of problem-solving outcomes are strongly linked \u2013both groups\nevaluate problem improvement quite similarly.\nAt this point, we can conclude that outcome evaluations on all three measures are\nrelated. Therefore, practice research networks such as SYPRENE should include bothclients\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 perspectives when assessing outcomes in naturalistic settingsin order to provide a greater overall understanding of therapeutic change.\nAcknowledgements\nOur thanks to Olivier Brosseau, Mario Blaise, and Emmanuelle Gallin for their help-ful consultation.\nCon\ufb02ict of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no con\ufb02ict of interest.\nNotes\n1LACT is an acronym signifying \u2018Liberating Actions for Transformation.\u2019 LACT is a freestanding\nresearch, training, and psychotherapy institute based in Paris.

SYPRENE was originally called \u2018LACT Research\u2019; the name was changed to\nSYPRENE in 2018.\n2The terms client andpatient are both used extensively throughout the literature. Each term carries cer-\ntain implications (see Hoyt, 2017, pp. 1 \u20135 and 217 \u2013218).Client tends to emphasise a more egalitarian\nand less hierarchical therapeutic relationship with a subsequent de-emphasis on implications of pathol-\nogy, diagnosis, and expert (top-down) strategic treatments in favour of more collaborative/facilitative/strengths-oriented approaches (see Hoyt, 1994, pp. 2 \u20134). Keeping with popular practice in Australia,\nthe authors herein use the term client . As noted in Hoyt and Talmon (2014, p. 11), \u2018What one calls\nthe participants and the process ( therapy ?counseling ?treatment ?intervention ?consultation ?facilitation ?\nwork?practice ?meeting ?encounter ?conversation ?coaching ?) helps to establish a meaning context (topics,\nroles, power relations, ideas about how change occurs), and thus, in\ufb02uences their work together.\u2019\n3Different outcome measures have been added to the SYPRENE data recording system at differenttimes. The ORS and SRS (Miller & Duncan, 2004) as well as the client\u2019s evaluation of the problem-solving outcome and the evaluation of change were added in the last trimester of 2019.\n4In French, \u2018douleur.\u2019\n5The Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) measures how a person feels just before the session (on a scale from\n0 to 10) on four dimensions (individually, interpersonally, socially, globally).
