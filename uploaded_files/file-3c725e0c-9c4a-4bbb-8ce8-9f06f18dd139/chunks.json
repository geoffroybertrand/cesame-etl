This article reports initial outcome results. So far, twenty- seven \ntherapists from several countries using the MRI brief therapy strategic ap -\nproach have collected data for a wide range of problem diagnoses. Data \nare reported here for 1,150 completed cases. The drop- out rate was 19%. \nSignificant improvement or complete problem resolution was reported \nby therapists in 80% and by patients in 90% of cases, with an average of \n5.4 sessions and 5.3\u00a0months of treatment. Patients reported significant im -\nprovement on the GHQ- 12 with a large effect size, and 76% of cases were \nevaluated as reaching reliable and clinically significant change.\nPractitioner points\n1.

Working with patients from an interactional- systemic perspective that favours short- term problem- \nsolving strategies, this therapeutic approach has spread around the world and has taken many different forms and variations (Hoyt, 2019; Nichols, \n2003). Although MRI strategic- interactional therapy has \u2018stood the test of \ntime\u2019 (Hale and Frusha, 2016) and the general conclusion can be made \nthat strategic therapy works (Horigian et al., 2015, 2016; Jackson et al., \n2018; Nardone and Portelli, 2005; Pietrabissa et al., 2016; Wittezaele and \nNardone, 2016), the limited transferability of laboratory- based efficacy \nresearch into everyday clinical practice is often stressed in the litera-ture (Baucom et al., 2018; Lebow, 2018; Tasca et al., 2015; Teachman et \nal., 2012). Looking for solutions to fill the gap between laboratory and naturalistic psychotherapy outcome studies, practice research networks (PRNs) were introduced in the 1990s in the hope that large numbers of \ncases coming from real- life clinical practice would allow obtaining spe-\ncific information valid for everyday practice and greater generalisability \nof results and conclusions (Johnson et al., 2017; Thurin et al., 2012).\nThe Systemic Practice Research Network (SYPRENE), created by \nLACT\n1 Research in 2014, is a PRN of professionals, including therapists \nfrom several international institutes (Vitry et al., 2020). Following a \n\u2018real- world\u2019 research perspective (Seligman, 1995), SYPRENE\u2019s main \ngoal is to fill the research gap on the effectiveness and efficiency of stra-\ntegic therapy by developing a new therapy data recording and assess-ment platform that would create a database and allow communication \nbetween and amongst practitioners and researchers. SYPRENE aims to \nuse a minimum number of general measures to reduce costs and time demands, simplify assessment and training and allow comparisons be-\ntween different cases and techniques. Effectiveness characterises the \nmeasure of a treatment performance under natural clinical conditions. Efficacy deals with the measure of a treatment performance under ideal laboratory conditions such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) used \nby evidence- based medicine. Efficiency is the ratio between resources \nand effectiveness.\n1LACT is an acronym signifying \u2018Liberating Actions for Transformation\u2019.

Outcome results, combining patients\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 perspectives, are presented. Finally, a link between \nproblem- solving outcomes and changes in patients\u2019 psychosocial func-\ntioning is analysed, informing the discussion about the validity of dif-\nferent methods of outcome evaluation and the convergence between \noutcomes measured by different means and from different perspectives.\nMethods\nSYPRENE Digital Data Collection and Recording System\nData in SYPRENE are collected from both practitioners and patients, \nand then entered digitally into the data- recording system by the prac-\ntitioners (Vitry et al., 2020).

Answers are scored on a 5- point scale (0\u2013 4) to quantify the level \nof subjective psychological suffering. Thus, scores can range between 0 and 48. The GHQ- 12 provides a general health score and is widely used \nto measure change in psychotherapy research and everyday practice; it is quick and easy to complete by a patient; it can be used for different situations and problems; and it has been translated into a number of \nlanguages and possesses good validity and reliability characteristics, with \nconsistency ranging between .76 and .94 (Lesage et al., 2011; S\u00e1nchez- L\u00f3pez and Dresch, 2008; Werneke et al., 2000).\nPractitioners\u2019 and patients\u2019 evaluation of the problem- solving outcome\nTo what extent the patient\u2019s presenting problem had been solved \nduring the therapy in each case was assessed by the therapist and pa-tient at the end of the therapy on a 0\u2013 10- point scale (from 0\u00a0=\u00a0problem \nunsolved to 10\u00a0=\u00a0problem solved).\n3\nThese assessments are closely related and integrated into the stra-\ntegic therapy process. At the beginning of the therapy, a practitioner \nevaluates the contextual problem that brings a patient to therapy, the \nredundant attempted solution (Vitry et al., in press) that keeps a pa-tient stuck in the situation and the minimum needed to resolve the problem. Next, a practitioner works on the different levels of inter -\nvention (strategy, communication and relationship) using direct pre-scriptions or indirect suggestions. From the second session onwards, the practitioner asks at the beginning of each session if the patient has \ndone the prescriptions (behaviours, thoughts or other homework) they \n3The problem- solving scale originated with Molnar and de Shazer (1987) and was origi-\nnally called the \u2018inverted scale\u2019.", "position": "chunk_4", "metadata": {"page_range": "6-7", "section": "Introduction", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-4", "content": " session if the patient has \ndone the prescriptions (behaviours, thoughts or other homework) they \n3The problem- solving scale originated with Molnar and de Shazer (1987) and was origi-\nnally called the \u2018inverted scale\u2019.\n\nPreliminary Results from a (SYPRENE) 5\n\u00a9 2021 Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice in the UK.\nhave agreed upon. Once it is determined that the prescriptions have \nbeen implemented, the practitioner asks the patient if this has had an \neffect on symptoms in terms of reducing frequency and/or intensity. \nThis iterative process (Figure\u00a01) allows a practitioner to assess the pa-tient\u2019s problem- solving outcome from 0 to 10 (from problem unsolved \nto problem solved) session by session.\nWhen the patient\u2019s unsuccessful attempted solutions are stopped \nand the therapy process comes to an end, the practitioner asks the pa-tient to rate the problem- solving outcome on a 0\u2013 10- point scale (from \nproblem unsolved to problem solved). At times, practitioners may have different evaluations from those of patients if a therapist considers, for instance, that a patient underestimates his or her own progress (which may be part of the patient\u2019s difficulty, e.g. for a perfectionistic patient) \nor overestimates his or her progress (e.g. for someone who tends to be \noverly optimistic or exaggerates their accomplishments).\nFor the outcome analysis, practitioners\u2019 and patients\u2019 assessments \nwere prima facie and somewhat arbitrarily categorised as\n1.

Analysis and results are based on data from the twenty- \nseven active members of SYPRENE4 (those who have provided ratings \nfor at least one case), of whom fifteen were female and twelve were male. Their average age was 49\u00a0years (SD\u00a0=\u00a05.4), ranging between 37 \nand 60\u00a0years. The nationalities of the SYPRENE practitioners are as fol-lows: fourteen French, six Italian, two Mexican, one Spanish, one Belgian, one Swiss, one Canadian and one South African. Practitioners \nreported having an average of 16\u00a0years of experience as psychologists/\npsychotherapists (n\u00a0=\u00a011), therapists/counsellors (n\u00a0=\u00a016). All practi-tioners identified themselves as \u2018strategic therapists\u2019, and 18% (n\u00a0=\u00a04) \nalso specified Ericksonian hypnotherapy as a secondary specialisation.\nConsistent with the theory of redundant attempted solutions (RAS; \nVitry et al., in press), from which the MRI strategic approach was de-\nrived, when people try to solve problems, they often apply the very strategy that perpetuates the problems they seek to solve. Disrupting \nRAS can resolve \u2018stuckness\u2019 and thus allow change to occur. In MRI- style strategic- systemic therapy (Watzlawick et al., 1974; Fisch et al., 1982; \nNardone and Portelli, 2005; Nardone and Watzlawick, 1993, 2005), this is accomplished as the practitioner and client continuously provide one another with feedback and make adjustments.\nPatients. Since the beginning of SYPRENE data collection, data for \n2,027 patients seen individually have been recorded from the twenty- seven active therapists (data for the current article were retrieved from the system on 3 April 2020), including the following (Figure\u00a0 2): (1) \n1,150 patients (57%) with a final outcome evaluation on at least one \n4Ninety therapists opened an account to learn more about SYPRENE but did not con-\ntribute data.", "position": "chunk_6", "metadata": {"page_range": "7-9", "section": "Application clinique", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-6", "content": "April 2020), including the following (Figure\u00a0 2): (1) \n1,150 patients (57%) with a final outcome evaluation on at least one \n4Ninety therapists opened an account to learn more about SYPRENE but did not con-\ntribute data.\n\nPreliminary Results from a (SYPRENE) 7\n\u00a9 2021 Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice in the UK.\nmeasure (912 of them completed therapy with a closing meeting and \n238 terminated therapy early, thus were considered as drop- outs); (2) \n447 patients (22%) without an outcome evaluation (385 of whom were \u2018visitors\u2019 merely seeking information or for whom therapists did not collect data necessary for the outcome evaluation, and 62 who dropped out early and thus were not assessed at the last meeting); and (3) 430 \npatients (21%) who were still undergoing therapy at the moment of \ndata retrieval from the system.

Marital status \n(reported by 65% of patients) was 48% living alone (single, separated, \nwidowed) and 52% living as a couple (married or in a union). The aver -\nage age (indicated by 70% of patients) was 39.7 (SD\u00a0=\u00a013.6) years; 14% were under 25\u00a0years old, 51% between 25 and 44\u00a0years old, 31% between 45 and 64\u00a0years old and 4% were over 65\u00a0years old. Occupationally, 67% \nwere employed and 33% were inactive (e.g. without professions, job \nseeking or retired).\nMissing data analysis. As seen in Figure\u00a02, outcome data for 447 pa-\ntients (28% of 1,597 cases for whom therapy was finished in one or \nanother way) were not collected. Evaluation by the therapist was intro-\nduced as soon as the database was created (2014), GHQ- 12s were fully \nimplemented in 2018 and evaluation by the patient fully implemented \nin 2019. It can be observed that 2018 was the pivotal year from which \nautomated procedures were introduced that encourage practitioners to fill in the necessary data at the time of file closure. These pop- up proce-\ndures remind the practitioner that it is necessary to enter certain data. \nPractitioners are gradually reducing their rate of missing data.\nThe assumption that missing data occurred due to organisational \nand accidental reasons and that there is no systematic bias for missing data can be partially supported by the fact that no differences between \npatient groups with and without outcome data were found in regard to gender, age, relationship status or initial practitioners\u2019 and patients\u2019 problem severity evaluations as well as initial GHQ- 12 scores.\nResults\nStatistical analysis was conducted using SPSS- 21 software. For the 1,150 \ncases completed with outcome assessment, the average number of ses-\nsions was 5.4 (SD\u00a0=\u00a04.4), ranging from 1 to 35 sessions. In 10% of cases, \nintervention was completed after a single session; in 29% of cases, after two to three sessions; in 23% of cases, after four to five sessions; in 15% of cases, after six to seven sessions; and in 8% of cases, after eight to \nnine sessions.

For the sake of brevity, only problem categories included in ten or more cases are presented. The items in the table include interactional diagnoses (de Scorraille et al., 2017; Vitry et al., 2019; Watzlawick, 2009) such as relational problems at place of \nwork, relational problems with mistrust of others or relational problems \nwithin the couple. Data in Table\u00a01 indicate that interpersonal conflict, problems of self- esteem, mistrust and anxiety- related issues were the \nproblems most frequently reported by patients. It is also notable that, for most problem categories, the success rate ranged between 70% and 95%. The highest success rates (over 90%) were for perfectionism, pho-bias and problems related to change in the workplace, while the lowest \nsuccess rates (59%) were for issues related to borderline personality.\nProblem- solving outcome results based on practitioners\u2019 and patients\u2019 \nevaluations\nThe SYPRENE data recording system requires that, in each case after \nthe last appointment, the degree of problem improvement is evaluated on an 11- point scale (0\u2013 10). The average evaluation by practitioners \nat the last appointment was 6.0 (SD\u00a0=\u00a02.8, n\u00a0=\u00a01079) and ranged from \n0 to 10. Patients\u2019 evaluations on the same scale also ranged from 0 to 10, but the average score was somewhat higher: 7.1 (SD\u00a0=\u00a02.6, n\u00a0=\u00a0231). \nHaving in mind sample size differences, we calculated averages only for \nthose cases where problem- solving outcome was evaluated by both prac-\ntitioners and patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0219).

Again, when suc-\ncess rates were calculated for those cases which have both practitioners\u2019 \nand patients\u2019 evaluations (n\u00a0=\u00a0219), results revealed that practitioners evaluated 93% and patients 89% of the cases as successful.\nOutcome results based on GHQ- 12\nSince 2018, when the GHQ- 12 was introduced to the SYPRENE data \nrecording system, we have collected data from 180 patients who com-\npleted the questionnaire at the beginning of their first and at the end of their last appointment (Figure\u00a01). The within- group comparison of \nthe GHQ- 12 mean scores at the first (M\u00a0=\u00a030.83, SD\u00a0=\u00a08.52) and the last \n(M\u00a0=\u00a010.97, SD\u00a0=\u00a05.54) sessions revealed a statistically significant of de-\ncrease of subjective suffering (t\u00a0=\u00a026.58, p < .001) with large effect size \n(Cohen d\u00a0=\u00a01.68\n6, confidence interval for d\u00a0=\u00a01.44\u2013 1.92).\nThe difference of mean scores and effect size demonstrates statisti-\ncal significance of change on a group level, but due to its naturalistic nature, the data obtained from SYPRENE do not provide the oppor -\ntunity for comparison with any kind of control group. Thus, analysis of the reliable and clinically significant change (Jacobson and Truax, \n1991), which allows estimation of the benefits of an intervention on the \nindividual level compared with normative population data (how close \nto the normative or \u2018healthy\u2019 population a client has come during the \ntherapy), was performed for the GHQ- 12 data.\nThe concept of reliable change reflects the extent to which individ-\nual change on a measure exceeds the interval which represents the \nmeasurement variability of the instrument employed (Evans et al., \n1998). It is assessed using the standard error (SE) of measurement con-sidering that two repeated measurements were made: SE\ndiff\u00a0=\u00a0SD1\u221a2\u221a1- r \n(where SD1 is the standard deviation of baseline observations; r is the \nreliability of the measure7). The change is considered as reliable with \nprobability of 95% if it is larger than SEdiff\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.96 (Evans et al., 1998). \n6An online effect size calculator (Lenhard and Lenhard, 2016) for single- group repeated \nmeasures design (as suggested by Morris, 2008) was employed.\n7To simplify and shorten the encoding process of SYPRENE practitioners, enter the total \nGHQ- 12 scores, which does not allow calculation of internal reliability of the instrument based \non collected data. Thus, the GHQ- 12 internal reliability coefficient, provided in the litera-\nture for French and Spanish non- clinical populations (Lesage et al., 2011; S\u00e1nchez- L\u00f3pez and \nDresch, 2008) was used in this analysis since most data in this study come from these national \npopulations.", "position": "chunk_12", "metadata": {"page_range": "12-15", "section": "Application clinique", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-12", "content": " in the litera-\nture for French and Spanish non- clinical populations (Lesage et al., 2011; S\u00e1nchez- L\u00f3pez and \nDresch, 2008) was used in this analysis since most data in this study come from these national \npopulations.\n\nPreliminary Results from a (SYPRENE) 13\n\u00a9 2021 Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice in the UK.\nAccording to this formula, patients whose GHQ- 12 score difference be-\ntween the first and the last appointments exceeded 11.0 points were \nconsidered as reaching reliable change.\nThe change of a measure can be considered as clinically significant \nwhen there is a greater likelihood of the patient\u2019s post- treatment score \nfalling closer to the average score of the normative (non- clinical) popu-\nlation than to the average score of the treated (clinical) population. Statistically, this requires the determination of the cut- off point where \nthe probability of coming from each of the distributions is equal (Evans \net al., 1998): [(mean\nclin\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SDnorm) + (meannorm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SDclin)]/(SDnorm\u00a0+\u00a0SDclin)8. In \nour data, the estimated cut- off point was 22.8, so the patients whose \nGHQ- 12 scores were above the cut- off at the first appointment and \nbelow the cut- off at the last appointment were considered as having \nreached clinically significant change. The difference of the GHQ- 12 \nscore between the first and the last appointments was categorised as \nachieving or not achieving the reliable change, clinically significant \nchange or both (Table\u00a02).\nResults suggest that change, as measured by GHQ- 12, can be consid-\nered as reliable in 80% of cases and as clinically significant in 81% of cases. Accordingly, 76% (n\u00a0=\u00a0137) of the patients could be considered as reaching both reliable and clinically significant change. These re-sults are encouraging, especially considering that as many as 16% of the \npatients started better than the cut- off for clinically significant change \n(their GHQ- 12 scores were in the normal population range at the first \nappointment); thus, eliminating them from the calculations would dra-matically increase (up to 91%) the number of patients reaching reliable \nand clinically significant change. Finally, there were only 2% (n\u00a0=\u00a03) of patients who could (their initial GHQ- 12 scores were in the range of the \nclinical group) but failed to reach clinically significant change.\nRelationship between outcome results obtained by different measures\nSince three different outcome measures representing practitioners\u2019 and \npatients\u2019 perspectives were used, we further address the question of the \nrelationship between outcome results obtained using these measures. Since the problem- solving outcome was evaluated by practitioners and \n8For normative data, we used GHQ- 12 mean scores and SD from the articles, presenting \nGHQ- 12 data for non- clinical French and Spanish populations (Lesage et al., 2011; S\u00e1nchez- \nL\u00f3pez and Dresch, 2008). Due to the coding differences mentioned in the articles presented \nGHQ- 12 data with the 0- 1- 2- 3 scoring system, mean GHQ- 12 scores for normative population \nwere recalculated to match the 0- 1- 2- 3- 4 coding system used in this article.", "position": "chunk_13", "metadata": {"page_range": "15-16", "section": "Introduction", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-13", "content": "erences mentioned in the articles presented \nGHQ- 12 data with the 0- 1- 2- 3 scoring system, mean GHQ- 12 scores for normative population \nwere recalculated to match the 0- 1- 2- 3- 4 coding system used in this article.\n\n14 Gr\u00e9goire Vitry et al. \n\u00a9 2021 Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice in the UK.TABLE 2 The distribution of participants in different groups of reliable and clinically significant change\nReliable change reached?\nTotal No Yes\nClinically significant \nchange reached?Started better than cut- off (no need for \nclinically significant change)24 5 29 (16%)\nNo 3 2 5 (3%)\nYes 9 137 146 (81%)\nTotal: 36 (20%) 144 (80%) 180 (100%)", "position": "chunk_14", "metadata": {"page_range": "16-15", "section": "M\u00e9thodologie", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-14", "content": "e reached?\nTotal No Yes\nClinically significant \nchange reached?Started better than cut- off (no need for \nclinically significant change)24 5 29 (16%)\nNo 3 2 5 (3%)\nYes 9 137 146 (81%)\nTotal: 36 (20%) 144 (80%) 180 (100%)\n\nPreliminary Results from a (SYPRENE) 15\n\u00a9 2021 Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice in the UK.\npatients on a similar 0\u2013 10- point scale, analysis of these evaluations was \nconducted and revealed strong correlation (r =.77, p < .001, n\u00a0=\u00a0219). \nIn addition, moderate agreement between practitioners\u2019 and patients\u2019 \ncategorised evaluations of problem- solving outcomes (solved, partially \nsolved and not solved) was revealed (\u03ba =.550 (95% CI, .44 to .66), p < .001).\nThe problem- solving outcome measures indicate the state or severity \nof a problem at the end of the therapy. GHQ- 12 score at the last ap-\npointment also reflects the level of a patient\u2019s mental distress after the therapy. Thus, we analysed the relationship between problem- solving \noutcomes and GHQ- 12 scores at the last appointment. To account for \npossible differences in practitioners\u2019 impact on the delivery of therapy, a linear mixed model (Hox et al., 2017) was used to model the rela-tionship between the GHQ- 12 at the last appointment (as the outcome \nvariable) with practitioners\u2019 or patients\u2019 problem- solving outcome eval-\nuations and GHQ- 12 at the first appointment as fixed effects, as well as \npractitioners\u2019 identity as the random- effect variable on problem- solving \noutcome evaluation. The model included random slopes and random intercepts for problem- solving outcome evaluation. The software \u2018R\u2019 \nwas used, along with the \u2018lmer\u2019 library. Model was fitted with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML). As presented in Table\u00a03, the \nfixed- effect slope coefficient of practitioners\u2019 problem- solving outcome \nevaluation was\u00a0\u22121.42 (SD\u00a0=\u00a00.42, t = \u22123.32). Similar results (Table\u00a04) were \nobtained for patient\u2019s problem- solving outcome evaluation with a linear \nmixed model (fixed- effect patients\u2019 problem- solving slope coefficient \nwas\u00a0\u22121.24 (SD\u00a0=\u00a00.60, t = \u22122.08). Practitioners\u2019 and patients\u2019 random intercepts\u2019 standard deviation were equal to 33.5 and 61, respectively, on the GHQ- 12 scale ranging from 0 to 48 (patients\u2019 standard deviation \nis higher than the GHQ- 12 scale range due to the fact that random \nintercept is estimated as a Gaussian law which does not take the scale\u2019s limited range into account).\nFurthermore, practitioners\u2019 problem- solving outcome evalua-\ntion random slope\u2019s standard deviation was 0.75, while the one for patients was 0.8. Compared with fixed effects slope coefficients of practitioners (\u22121.42) and patients (\u22121.24), these standard deviations \nsuggest that for some the effect may be negligible and for others it \nmay be much larger. However, as random effects are computed ac-cording to a normal law, 95% of practitioners and patients have a co-\nefficient between two standard deviations. Thus, except for extreme \ncases, the relationship between problem solving and GHQ- 12 is neg-\native, with some being close to 0 and others quite close to\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.

SYPENE data suggest good efficiency for strategic therapy. Encouraging outcome results were achieved with an average of 5.4 sessions, within an average of 5.3\u00a0months. Length of the therapy in this study is comparable with results obtained by the Centro di Terapia Strategica d\u2019Arezzo in their research over the past three decades (Nardone and Balbi, 2012). In addi-tion, the drop- out rate was only 19%, which compares favourably with \nother large- scale studies (see Barrett et al., 2008; Swift and Greenberg, \n2012; Wells et al., 2013).\n3. There is a significant positive relationship between outcomes evaluated by different measures and from different perspectives. While all outcome measures in SYPRENE rely on self- report evaluations by patients and \ntheir therapists, credibility of outcome data comes from the fairly good correspondence between the various evaluations with the following im-plications: (1) large improvement was obtained from patients\u2019 and prac-titioners\u2019 perspectives, indicating that strategic therapy helps to improve the problem situation and decrease patients\u2019 feelings of subjective distress; (2) practitioners\u2019 and patients\u2019 evaluations of problem- solving outcome \nwere strongly correlated with moderate agreement, suggesting that prob-lem improvement was perceived quite similarly from both perspectives; (3) practitioners\u2019 and patients\u2019 evaluations of problem improvement were significantly linked to the patients\u2019 GHQ- 12 scores at the end of ther -\napy, even when controlling for GHQ- 12 baseline scores and differences \nbetween therapists. At this point, we can conclude that outcome evalu-ations on all three measures point to the same direction and are related but not identical. Such results might suggest that measures from different sources and of different nature (such as subjective scales and standardised questionnaires) could reflect different perspectives of therapeutic change. Hence, practice research networks, such as SYPRENE, should include both patients\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 perspectives when assessing outcomes in naturalistic settings to provide a greater overall understanding of thera-peutic change.", "position": "chunk_18", "metadata": {"page_range": "19-21", "section": "Application clinique", "key_concepts": ["communication circulaire", "feedback", "MRI"]}}, {"id": "chunk-18", "content": "actice research networks, such as SYPRENE, should include both patients\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 perspectives when assessing outcomes in naturalistic settings to provide a greater overall understanding of thera-peutic change.\n\nPreliminary Results from a (SYPRENE) 19\n\u00a9 2021 Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice in the UK.\nLimitations, challenges and opportunities\nAlthough the presented preliminary results are promising, they are \nsomewhat limited by the size of our sample as well as a lack of broad \nnational heterogeneity. In terms of effectiveness, the present results mainly reflect the perspective of the therapist and the patient regarding overall outcome ratings. The recent introduction (in 2018) of the GHQ- 12 patient- rated questionnaire at the beginning and end of the therapy \nprocess (n\u00a0=\u00a0180) has shown encouraging results. We are also consider -\ning the use of additional questionnaires about the patient\u2019s experience of the change process. However, the benefits of more measures need \nto be weighed against the possibility of asking too many questions. In \nterms of efficiency, we will further explore possible factors, including for those cases when problems remain unresolved. In addition to measur -\ning the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions, SYPRENE data will make it possible to evaluate more qualitative dimensions and change processes.\nSince SYPRENE is a living PRN, we have naturalistic patterns of data \nrather than having identical cell sizes throughout. In the future, more data will allow more robust statistical analyses, such as evaluation of the multiple factors (e.g. gender, age, relationship status and number of \nsessions) possibly influencing the outcome results. One of the import-\nant issues for future research is control of missing data. In the present study, even though this group did not differ from the participants with complete outcome data in respect to sociodemographic characteristics, \nwe do not know for sure whether there were no differences in life cir -\ncumstances or other variables possibly accounting for outcome results. \nTo reduce the proportion of missing data, we are considering the possi-bility of an additional evaluation several months after the therapy. The \nevaluation of the role of practitioner differences is also an important \nquestion which we hope to explore more in the near future.
